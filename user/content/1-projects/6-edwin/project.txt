Released in 2015 with retail partnerts such as Best Buy, Apple, and Target, Edwin has evolved into a power brand including a product just for babies â€” a project fine-tuned with Jessica Alba and our participation on Apple TV's Planet of the Apps, a fully animated world populated with friends, and a full-length album on iTunes featuring Edwin's own band The Wingmen."
