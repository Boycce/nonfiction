    Edwin is a waterproof, app-connected
    rubber ducky designed to engage children
    at bath time, relax them before naptime,
    and soothe them during sleepy time. He
    even plays music and interacts
    underwater. Color indicator lights and
    the app help parents determine water
    temperature instantly.

Edwin has since evolved into a power brand including a product just for babies â€” a project fine-tuned with Jessica Alba and our participation on Apple TV's Planet of the Apps, a fully animated world populated with friends, and a full-length album on iTunes."
