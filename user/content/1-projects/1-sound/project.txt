And we're building a headphone that allows you to hear and connect with others and your surroundings in entirely new ways."

    Sound's touch-control system transcends other touch technologies by taking advantage of the device's outer real estate. Using natural human motion, listeners can execute multiple playback controls -- including volume adjustment, pause, play, skip a track, replaying a track, accept/deny call, and additional feature controls.
    
    Sound's design provides the space to house our advanced hardware and support our superior software, while still being unobtrusive and securely attached to the listener's head.
