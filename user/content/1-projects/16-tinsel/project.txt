    As the line between work and play
    changes, so does the need for
    accessibility. Tinsel breaks new ground
    with their connected jewelry line,
    Dipper. Nonfiction worked closely with
    Tinsel to design jewelry that funnels
    music and conference calls to the wearer
    no matter the setting.

    Tinsel Dipper draws upon materials that
    are uncommon in the audio industry. Gold
    plated woven cables and metal parts are
    key to a luxurious experience.

  text1: "Moving the aesthetic from standard consumer electronic memes is key to Dipper's success. Inspiration came from geometric architectures, structural forms, and natural crystalline forms."
