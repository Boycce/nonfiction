    More than 700 3D prints were required to
    refine the ergonomics of the Sound
    Headphones. Comfort, easy donning,
    stability and optimized driver and mic
    positions have been considered to create
    the optimum music experience.

    The touch-control system transcends other touch technologies by taking advantage of the device's outer real estate. Using natural human motion, listeners can execute multiple playback controls -- including volume adjustment, pause, play, skip a track, replaying a track, accept/deny call, and additional feature controls.
    
    The design provides space to house our advanced hardware and support our superior software, while still being unobtrusive and securely attached to the listener's head.
