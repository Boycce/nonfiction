    Trio allows people with essential
    tremors to do tasks that would otherwise
    not be possible. Users regain the
    freedom to type on a computer or
    smartphone, write a letter, hold a cup
    of coffee and do many other tasks that
    require fine motor skills.

Trio is the first FDA approved, wrist-worn essential tremors therapy device that is calibrated and prescribed specifically to the patient's condition."

    The discrete, yet familiar form factor
    is easy to use and contributes to the
    success of the Trio therapeutic
    wearable.

    Docking the Trio for charging was a key
    interaction. Through extensive user
    studies, we discovered that aligning
    charging contacts was a challenge for
    users. Through an empathetic and
    iterative design approach, we carefully
    modeled a base that funneled the
    wristband into the docking position. The
    addition of magnets guaranteed good
    contact every time.
