Heading1: Design & Philosophy

----

Questions1: 

- 
  question: Our design philosophy.
  answer: >
    Fun and sophistication. We bring
    together design and engineering to
    ensure innovative product development
    and beautiful products down to the last
    detail.
- 
  question: Our design process.
  answer: |
    We utilize a four-step process: Discover problems and identify opportunities, Design solutions (sketch, 3D modeling, prototyping), followed by a Refinement phase and finally the Delivery of files. Following this process, we offer extended services to ensure design intent is kept through the complexities of manufacturing.
    Throughout the whole process, we collaborate with the client, making decisions together, and advising them on calculated risks.
- 
  question: How we approach to sustainability.
  answer: >
    Plastic is inherent to mass
    manufacturing, and we cannot always
    replace it with a more sustainable
    material. In those cases, we strive to
    create beautiful products that people
    want to own for years. We call it
    sustainability through desire.

Questions2: 

- 
  question: >
    Do you practice lean product
    development?
  answer: >
    Closely aligned design, engineering, and
    development teams can reduce time to
    market while mitigating risk and
    eliminating handoff delays between
    separate disciplines.
- 
  question: Do you make prototypes?
  answer: >
    Yes. Prototyping is integral to our
    design process. We prototype early and
    often. 3D printing, foam models,
    cut-and-sew samples are created in our
    workshop. High-end cosmetic and
    functional prototypes are outsourced.

Heading3: Client  Questions

Questions3: 

- 
  question: Do you have an expertise?
  answer: >
    Yes and no. No matter the project,
    it’s our duty to rapidly learn all the
    constraints and strategically push them
    beyond the industry standard. In a
    sense, we quickly become experts on any
    project we undertake. Aside from that,
    we have a lot of experience in audio,
    consumer electronics, medical devices,
    luxury, soft goods and packaging.
- 
  question: Have you worked with overseas vendors?
  answer: "Definitely. We work directly with manufacturing and prototyping partners on a regular basis – whether onsite factory visits or via conference calls. Strong relationships are the key to a product's success. These relationships help shepherd products through production and ensure quality, durability and attention to detail."
- 
  question: Do you collaborate with your clients?
  answer: 'Always, unless they ask us not to. We engage with our clients to gain firsthand product insights. We frequently sketch, workshop and whiteboard together.  The insights we gain help us understand the product limits and how we can exceed expectations.'
- 
  question: >
    What kind of client projects do you
    prefer?
  answer: "We don't subscribe to a single product category. Rather, we prefer clients that are willing to challenge conventional thinking and have fun while doing it. We engage, collaborate and go wide, then systematically narrow to a focused, cohesive solution."
