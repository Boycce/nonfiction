Questions1: 

- 
  question: "What's special about working with Nonfiction?"
  answer: "We are small, and like to keep it that way. That doesn't mean we haven't taken on big projects. We are exclusively made of highly experienced, intelligent, efficient and well-rounded designers. This means no intern is going to run your project, ever. This is the only way we can guarantee the highest quality of work for each of our clients, from startup to big corporation."
- 
  question: What is your design philosophy?
  answer: >
    Fun and sophistication. We bring
    together design and engineering to
    ensure innovative product development
    and beautiful objects down to the last
    detail.
- 
  question: How do you work?
  answer: |
    Every project is unique, but we typically follow a multi-step process. We Discover problems and identify opportunities, Design solutions (sketch, 3D modeling, prototyping), followed by a Refinement phase and Delivery of files. We are often asked to Extend our services through manufacturing, distribution, marketing and more. This extended engagement ensures design intent is kept through the complexities of product development and manufacturing.
    During the whole process, we collaborate with the client,  PD firm and CM, making decisions together, and advising on calculated risks.
- 
  question: How do you approach sustainability?
  answer: >
    Plastic is inherent to mass
    manufacturing, and we cannot always
    replace it with a more sustainable
    material. In those cases, we strive to
    create beautiful products that people
    will own for years. We have extensive
    experience using manufacturing processes
    that limit or eliminate wasted
    materials, practice design for
    disassembly when applicable. We also use
    recycled and recyclable materials,
    non-toxic materials and finishes when it
    makes a difference.

Questions2: 

- 
  question: >
    Do you practice lean product
    development?
  answer: >
    Yes, when the client is open for it.
    Closely aligned design, engineering, and
    development teams can reduce time to
    market while mitigating risk and
    eliminating handoff delays between
    separate disciplines.
- 
  question: Do you make prototypes?
  answer: >
    Yes. Prototyping is integral to our
    design process. We prototype early and
    often. 3D printing, foam models,
    cut-and-sew samples are created in our
    workshop. High-end cosmetic and
    functional prototypes are outsourced.
- 
  question: Do you work with overseas vendors?
  answer: "Definitely. We work directly with manufacturing and prototyping partners on a regular basis – whether onsite factory visits or via conference calls. Strong relationships are the key to a product's success. These relationships help shepherd products through production and ensure quality, durability and attention to detail."
- 
  question: >
    How comfortable are you with Design For
    Manufacturing?
  answer: "DFM would be our specialty. This is precisely why we named our company Nonfiction. We don't see the point of fancy concepts that lead to nowhere. Bringing beautiful, useful, well-tested, well-engineered and innovative products to market is what we do best. Over the years, we have become known to solve problems most design studios can't handle. For us, every single detail matters: the shape, the quality of materials, where it is sourced, how it is assembled, the weight and thickness of your product, part alignment, the need for features. We question everything and remove as much as possible. We believe in products that do few things, but do them right."
- 
  question: Can you help us manage our factory?
  answer: >
    Yes. Nonfiction has close bilingual
    partners who offer sourcing, product
    development and quality control on
    Chinese ground. They will happily guide
    you through the process if needed.

Heading3: Client  Questions

Questions3: 

- 
  question: Do you have an expertise?
  answer: >
    Yes and no. No matter the project,
    it’s our duty to rapidly learn all the
    constraints and strategically push them
    beyond the industry standard. In a
    sense, we quickly become experts on any
    project we undertake. Aside from that,
    we have a lot of experience in audio,
    consumer electronics, medical devices,
    luxury, soft goods and packaging.
- 
  question: Do you collaborate with your clients?
  answer: 'Always. We engage with our clients to gain firsthand product insights. We frequently sketch, workshop and whiteboard together.  Oftentimes we help construct and actively participate in user studies. We keep the conversation casual, yet targeted. This lowers barriers and encourages open dialogue between ourselves and our clients. The insights we gain help us understand the product limits and how we can exceed expectations.'
- 
  question: >
    What kind of client projects do you
    prefer?
  answer: "We don't subscribe to a single product category. Rather, we prefer clients that are willing to challenge conventional thinking and have fun while doing it. We engage, collaborate and go wide, then systematically narrow to a focused, cohesive solution."
- 
  question: Do you work for equity share?
  answer: >
    Unless you have an excellent track
    record of building hardware companies
    and selling them for millions, the
    answer is no.
- 
  question: >
    Do you bill by project or time and
    materials?
  answer: >
    It depends. Project-based contracts are
    recommended for the best quality of work
    because it retains our focused attention
    on your project. We highly recommend
    this arrangement for the initial design
    phase that gets you to the prototyping
    phase. For anything beyond that, time
    and materials is most likely more
    manageable.
- 
  question: "I don't see work in my category. How do I know you can work in it?"
  answer: "It is our job as designers to question and rethink the way things have been done in any product category. Additionally, we routinely have to learn new technologies and regulations to adapt to our clients' needs. Our goal is to bring you designs no one else could come up with. Occasionally the idea is so new (yet manufacturable) that you may end up with a patentable idea."
- 
  question: >
    Can you help us design the future of our
    company?
  answer: >
    Absolutely. Branding and product
    strategies are part of our capabilities.
    If you have an idea or a technology and
    would like to turn it into products
    people desire for the long run, we can
    help you.
- 
  question: "Nonfiction seems pretty small and I'm not sure you can take care of our project."
  answer: >
    Each designer at Nonfiction was
    specifically selected for their talent,
    professionalism and efficiency. Clients
    are always surprised by the amount of
    work that comes out of our studio and
    how closely aligned it is to their
    specific needs. Being nimble helps us
    react quickly to the inevitable mishaps
    of product development. This is why all
    of our clients are recurring ones.
